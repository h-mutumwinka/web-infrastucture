Weather  Application
Overview
I created this Weather Forecast Application to provide real-time weather updates based on city input. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays key weather details, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with dynamic icons. The goal was to make it user-friendly, responsive, and lightweight.

Features
üåç Search by City: Enter a city name to get the latest weather updates.
‚õÖ Real-time Weather Updates: Fetches live data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
üå¶ Dynamic Weather Icons: Displays weather conditions with changing icons.
üìç Geolocation Support: Detects the user's location for automatic weather updates.
üì± Responsive Design: Works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
‚ö° Fast & Lightweight: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for efficiency.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
API: OpenWeatherMap API
Deployment: Web Server 1 & Web Server 2
Load Balancing: Nginx to efficiently distribute traffic between servers
Deployment Details
I deployed the application on two web servers (Web Server-01 & Web Server-02) and set up a load balancer (Nginx) to manage incoming requests. This setup ensures:

Even request distribution to prevent overloading a single server
High availability and better performance
Reliable access, even if one server goes down
How to Use
Open the application in your web browser.
Enter a city name in the search box.
Click the search button to fetch weather data.
View real-time weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.
Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/enockmugisha1/Front-end-projects.git
Navigate to the weather project folder:
cd Front-end-projects/whether
Open whether.html in a browser to run the application locally.
API Configuration
To use the OpenWeatherMap API, get an API key and replace it in your JavaScript file:

const config = {
    apiUrl: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather",
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"
};
Future Improvements
Add a 5-day weather forecast feature
Implement dark mode support
Include additional weather details like UV index and air quality
